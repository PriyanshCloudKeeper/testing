# Account-Wise Breakup

The Account-Wise Breakup section provides **daily** and **monthly** expense details, enabling precise monitoring at the individual account level within a MAV (Multi-Account View).

---

### Linked Account Insights

Similar to the MAV view, users can also see the **Billing Console** view for each individual linked account within this section. This allows for detailed tracking and analysis of spending patterns on a per-account basis.

---

### Downloadable Reports

All data can be downloaded in **XLSX workbook format**, providing the same level of detail and insights as available on the Lens dashboard.
