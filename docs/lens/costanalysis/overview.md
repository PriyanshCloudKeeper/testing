# Cost Analysis

## Cost Explorer

The Cost Explorer dashboard is similar to what customers see on their AWS Console, but enhanced with additional filtering and resource-level detail.

---

### Key Features

- View **day-on-day** or **month-on-month** cost trends, down to the **resource level**.
- Apply multiple filters such as service, instance type, and account ID to refine analysis.
- Group results by parameters like service, instance type, or account ID for deeper insights into cost breakdowns across accounts.
- Export filtered and grouped data as an **XLSX workbook** for further offline analysis.

---

## Cost Explorer Saved Report

Customers can create and save reports with their selected filters and groupings, including:

- Date ranges
- Tags
- Specific services

Saved reports (e.g., costs for tagged resources over the last month) can be quickly accessed later without needing to reapply the same filters and groupings.
