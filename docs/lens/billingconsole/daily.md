# Daily Breakdown Overview

The **Daily Breakdown** page provides a granular, day-by-day view of your AWS spend for the current month. It helps you **track daily fluctuations**, identify **cost anomalies**, and monitor **service-wise usage trends** effectively.

---

### Features

- **Daily Cost Table**: View total daily costs and compare spending across each day to spot anomalies or spikes.
- **Cost Trends Graph**: Visualize spending fluctuations with a line or bar graph to identify trends or unusual surges in usage.
- **Service-wise Daily Breakdown**: Analyze how much each AWS service (like EC2, S3, or Data Transfer) contributed to your costs on a given day.

This detailed breakdown supports better **cost control**, **anomaly detection**, and **resource optimization**.
