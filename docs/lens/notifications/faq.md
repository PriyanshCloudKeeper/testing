## Budget Alerts

**Q: Fixed budget alerts vs Relative budget alerts?**  
A: Fixed Budget Alerts – Trigger when spending exceeds a specific dollar amount you set for each budget period. Example: Alert if spend > $5,000 in a month.

Relative Budget Alerts – Trigger when spending exceeds a percentage change compared to a previous period, over a set number of days. Example: Alert if spend increases by more than 20% compared to the last 7 days.
