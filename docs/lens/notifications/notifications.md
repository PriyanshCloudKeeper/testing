# Notification Groups

The **Notification Groups** feature enables you to configure **custom alert groups**. These groups can be linked to either **email** or **Slack** channels to ensure timely alerts are sent to the right recipients for any cost anomalies or threshold breaches.

It helps streamline and centralize alert management across teams. By configuring email and Slack notifications, you can ensure that the right team members are always aware of important cost trends, spikes, and breaches.

### **Email Notification Groups**

This section allows you to create **email-based notification groups**. Each group can have multiple recipients who will be notified when a threshold breach occurs.

To add an email notification group:

1. Click on the **Add Notification Group** button.
2. Enter the **Group name** and select the **Recipients**.
3. Once completed, click **Save** to confirm the changes.

Below is the example for adding an email notification group:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/notifications/notifications-settings.png" alt="Notification settings" />
</div>

### **Slack Notification Groups**

Slack integration allows you to send notifications directly to **Slack channels**. This feature enables teams to be notified of any anomalies directly in their communication workflow.

To add a Slack notification channel:

1. Click on **Add Slack Channel**.
2. Provide the **Channel ID** and the **OAuth Token**.
3. Follow the provided instructions in the integration guide.

Hereâ€™s an example of the Slack integration form:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/notifications/notifications-settings.png" alt="Notification settings" />
</div>

### **Managing Recipients**

Once the notification groups are set up, you can view and manage them on the **Notification Groups** page. Here, you can see all the existing notification groups along with their respective recipients.

For example, the **DevOps Admins** group includes recipients from the **DevOps** team, while the **Finance** group is set up for **financial monitoring**.

Below is an example of the **Notification Groups** overview:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/notifications/notifications-overview.png" alt="Notifications overview" />
</div>
