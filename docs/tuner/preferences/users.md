# Users Page

The **Users Page** in the **Preferences** section allows administrators to manage users, assign roles, and configure user access to different features within the platform.

---

### User List

The **User List** displays all users in the system, along with their details, including **Name**, **Email ID**, **Access Level** (e.g., Lens, Tuner), and the **Last Login** information. You can easily filter, search, or view the details of any user from this list.

#### Example

In the image below, you can see a sample **User List** with the respective user details.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/preferences/preferences-user-dashboard.png" alt="User preferences dashboard" />
</div>

---

### Add New User

To add a new user, click the **Add New User** button. This will open a modal where you can enter the **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Email ID** of the user. You will also need to assign roles for the user under the **Lens** and **Tuner** categories.

Users can be assigned different levels of access:

- **Lens**
- **Tuner**

Additionally, you can assign the user to a specific **Multi-Account View (MAV)** to give them visibility into the associated accounts.

#### Example

Below is an example of the **Add New User** modal where you can input user details and roles.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '20px' }}>
  <img src="/img/preferences/adduser-1.png" alt="Add New User" style={{ maxWidth: '45%', height: 'auto' }} />
  <img src="/img/preferences/adduser-2.png" alt="Add New User" style={{ maxWidth: '45%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

### Edit User Access

Once a user is added, you can edit their access levels, update their email address, or change their role. The **Actions** column of the user list provides options to **edit** or **remove** users as needed.

---

### Delete User

If a user is no longer needed, you can remove them from the system by clicking the **Delete** button in the **Actions** column. Deleting a user removes their access to the platform and associated resources.
