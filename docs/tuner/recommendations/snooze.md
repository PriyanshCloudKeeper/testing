# Snoozed Recommendations

The **Snoozed Recommendations** section displays all recommendations that have been temporarily deferred by the user.  
This feature allows you to **pause** actions on specific recommendations while keeping them for later review.

## Overview of Snoozed Recommendations

When you snooze a recommendation, it is removed from the active list and moved to the **Snoozed tab**.  
From this section, you can:

- View all snoozed recommendations.
- Review details such as the **resource**, **type of recommendation**, **reason for snooze**, and **date snoozed**.
- Choose to **unsnooze** a recommendation to make it active again.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

</div>

If there are no snoozed items, the dashboard will display a **blank state** indicating that no recommendations have been deferred.

## Key Features

- **Centralized List**: All snoozed items are visible in one place.
- **Unsnooze Option**: Reactivate snoozed recommendations with a single click.
- **Deferred Review**: Ideal for recommendations requiring approval or further investigation.

The Snoozed Recommendations page ensures that **no optimization opportunity is lost**, even if actions are postponed temporarily.
