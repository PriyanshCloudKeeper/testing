# Tags Management

The **Tags** page enables you to create and manage **tags** across your AWS environment. Tags are a powerful way to logically group resources within an AWS account for better organization, cost allocation, and tracking.

---

### Create Tags

You can create tags to associate with your resources, such as environments, teams, or cost centers. Tags can be applied to multiple **MAVs** (Multi-Account Views) for consistent management across different AWS accounts. 

When creating a new tag, provide a **Tag Name** and an optional **Tag Description** to describe the purpose of the tag. After defining the tag, you can associate it with **MAVs** to organize resources effectively.

#### Example

Here is an example of the **Create Tag** modal, where users can input tag details and choose which MAVs to associate with the tag.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/preferences/tag-cr.png" alt="Create Tag" />
</div>

### Manage Tags

You can also manage existing tags by editing their name, description, or the MAVs associated with them. The **Tags** page allows users to view all available tags and modify their settings as needed.

#### Example

Below is an example of the **Tags Management** screen, where you can view the tags and their associated MAVs.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/img/preferences/tag-1.png" alt="Manage Tags" />
</div>
