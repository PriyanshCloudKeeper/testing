This section provides detailed insights into your costs across various AWS services:

- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: Displays your EC2-related costs, which typically make up the largest portion of your bill.
- **Simple Storage Service (S3)**: Breakdown of storage costs, helping users optimize data storage and find cost-saving opportunities.
- **Data Transfer**: Shows how much is being spent on inter-region or external data transfer.
- **Amazon CloudFront**, **Amazon CloudWatch**: Provides detailed breakdowns for content delivery and monitoring services.

The dashboards empower users to drill down into their **service-specific costs** and optimize their usage patterns.
