# Reservation Summary

The **Reservation Summary** page provides an overview of all your active and expired Reserved Instances across AWS services like **EC2**, **RDS**, **ElastiCache**, **Redshift**, **OpenSearch**, and **Savings Plan**. It allows users to track and manage the reservations for compute resources in their cloud environment.

This page helps you to stay on top of reserved capacity, monitor expirations, and view pricing details such as **Hourly Price**, **Upfront Price**, and **Quantity**. The table view displays all key details and enables easy access to critical information about your reserved instances.

### Request New Reserved Instances

If your reservation is nearing expiry or you want to purchase more capacity, you can **Request Reserved Instances** directly from the page. The **Request Reserved Instances** section lets you search for different types of Reserved Instances based on instance class, deployment option, product description, and region.

This feature makes it simple to add or renew reserved instances, ensuring you maintain cost-effective usage of your cloud resources.

### Active vs Expired Reservations

The Reservation Summary page distinguishes between **Active** and **Expired** reservations. Active reservations are those that are still valid, while expired reservations have already passed their term. Itâ€™s important to keep track of these to ensure that you are not losing out on benefits from your Reserved Instances.

- **Active Reservations**: Currently in use and are still valid.
- **Expired Reservations**: Past their expiration date. You may need to renew or purchase new instances.

Both active and expired reservations are listed, and you can take appropriate actions such as renewal or modification as needed.


### Coverage Insights

The **Coverage Insights** feature provides visibility into how much of your usage is covered by Reserved Instances. It calculates the percentage of usage covered by Reserved Instances versus On-Demand usage.

This helps you identify opportunities for optimization. If your coverage is low, you might want to increase the number of Reserved Instances to reduce costs. The coverage insights are displayed as a **Coverage Percentage** graph.
